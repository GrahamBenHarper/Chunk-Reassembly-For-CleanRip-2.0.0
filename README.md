# CleanRip Chunk Reassembly
This batch file takes Wii game ISO chunks produced by CleanRip 2.0.0 by emu_kidid and reassembles them into a functional game ISO file. It must be placed in the same directory as the file you'd like to reassemble. The script is self-explanatory and it can combine up to 16 chunks at once.
