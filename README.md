# Chunk Reassembly for CleanRip 2.0.0 ISO Files (Version 1.01)
This Windows batch file takes Wii game ISO chunks produced by CleanRip 2.0.0 by emu_kidid and reassembles them into a functional game ISO file. It must be placed in the same directory as the file you'd like to reassemble. The script will gently guide you through the reassembly process.
This program does not delete your original chunks when it's finished because it's a good idea to check if your new ISO is functional before deleting the chunks.

This has only been tested on Windows 7, but should work on any version that supports a similar terminal.
